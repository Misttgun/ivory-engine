- Add an observer patern in place of eventbus
- Add a shared context where we can get access to global classes (SDL_Renderer, Camera, RessourcesManager, etc) -> put it in the Registry
- Implement custom allocator for memory management instead of using smart pointers
- Implement UI framework
- Take a look at sounds
- Add a map editor (I will use Tiled)
- Make a game -> (I was thinking of making a tactical RPG, but I can make an adventure RPG like the Godot adventure tutorial + AI)
- Improve debug tools (Framerate counter is bugged)
- Look at this articles for SDL2 tutorials -> https://thenumb.at/cpp-course/index.html#sdl
